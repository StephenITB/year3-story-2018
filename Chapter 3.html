		<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

		<p>
		There I was is sitting at the bar staring at my drink when a large,
		trouble-making biker steps up next to me,
		grabs my drink and gulps it down in one swig.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Well, whatcha gonna do about it?" he says, menacingly, as I burst into tears.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Come on, man," the biker says, "I didn't think you'd CRY. I can`t stand to see a man crying."
