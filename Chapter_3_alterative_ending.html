		<h2>Chapter 3 alterative_ending</h2>

		<p>
		A little guy is sitting at the bar just staring at his drink for half an hour when this big trouble-making biker steps next to him,
		grabs his drink and gulps it down in one swing.
		</p>

		<p>
		Then the poor little guy starts crying.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Come on, man. I'm just giving you a hard time," the biker says.
		"I didn't think you'd CRY.  I can't stand to see a man cry."
		</p>

		<p>
		"This is the worst day of my life," says the little guy between sobs...
		"I can't do anything right.

		</p>

		<p>
		I overslept and was late to an important meeting, so my boss fired me.When I went to the parking lot, I found my car was stolen and I don't have any insurance.
		I left my wallet in the cab I took home. I found my wife in bed with the gardener and my dog bit me. So, I came to this bar trying to work up the courage to put an end to my life,
		and then you show up and drink the damn poison."
		</p>

		<p>
		The End :)
