		1. The average cost of rehabilitating one seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony,
		two of the most expensively saved animals were released back into the wild, amid cheers and applause from onlookers. One minute later,
		in full view of everyone, a killer whale ate them both.

		2. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist
		towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door,
		breaking his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to his Walkman.

		3. Two animal right protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany. Suddenly the pigs - 
		all 2,000 of them - escaped through a broken fence and stampeded, trampling the two hapless protesters to death.
