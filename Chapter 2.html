		<h3>My favourite animal</h3>

		<p>
		Our teacher asked us what our favourite animal was, and I said, "Fried chicken."
		She said I wasn't funny, but she couldn't have been right, because everyone else in the class laughed
		</p>

		<p>
		My parents told me to always be truthful and honest, and I am. Fried chicken is my favourite animal.
		I told my dad what happened, and he said my teacher was probably a member of PETA.
		He said they love animals very much. I do, too.  Especially chicken, pork and beef.
		Anyway, my teacher sent me to the principal's office. I told him what happened, and he laughed, too.
		Then he told me not to do it again.

		The next day in class my teacher asked me what my favourite live animal was. I told her it was chicken.
		She asked me why, just like she'd asked the other children. So I told her it was because you could make them into fried chicken.
		She sent me back to the principal's office again. He laughed, and told me not to do it again.
		I don't understand. My parents taught me to be honest, but my teacher doesn't like it when I am.
