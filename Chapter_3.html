		<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

		<p>
		There I was is sitting at the bar staring at my drink when a large,
		trouble-making biker steps up next to me,
		grabs my drink and gulps it down in one swig.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Well, whatcha gonna do about it?" he says, menacingly, as I burst into tears.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Come on, man," the biker says, "I didn't think you'd CRY. I can`t stand to see a man crying."
		</p>

		<p>
		"This is the worst day of my life," I say. "I'm a complete failure. I was late to a meeting and my boss fired me.
		When I went to the parking lot, I found my car had been stolen and I don't have any insurance.
		I left my wallet in the cab I took home. I found my old lady in bed with the gardener and then my dog bit me."
		</p>

		<p>
		"So I came to this bar to work up the courage to put an end to it all, I buy a drink,
		I drop a capsule in and sit here watching the poison dissolve; then you, you jack-ass,
		show up and drink the whole thing! But enough about me, how's your day going?"
		</p>

		<p>
		The End :)
